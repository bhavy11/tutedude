task 1:

i declared function name factorial
make variabl name "f" give initial value 1 for multiple 
give condition if this happens factorial not exists
make for loop
in else statement i gave range 1 to num+1 because range give me the secpond last num
now the logic is f store 1 initial then 1*i = 1*1 =1, now f become 1 and i=2 so f=1*2 and ....
last i am printing f

task 2:
import math 
using math inbuilt functioons
find sqrt
log
sin
take input from user 
call function
